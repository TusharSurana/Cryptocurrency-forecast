# Cryptocurrency-forecast
This POWER BI project uses historical data to analyze mainstream cryptocurrency's data and forecast their future prices.

About the project:
  This project makes use of a cryptocurrency database from KAGGLE, which includes information about the cryptocurrency's daily prices, highs, lows, etc.
  I've further tried to aggregate data and help visualise it in the form of interactive line charts.
  I took help of various slicers, cards and buttons to make it user interactive and present the information on the line charts based on the options selected.
  The primary function of the charts is to forecast the future prices and market capitalisation based on the historical data.
